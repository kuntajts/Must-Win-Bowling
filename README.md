# Must-Win-Bowling
Calculating bowling score.

Project Hosted At: [http://jordantsmith.net/mustwin/](http://jordantsmith.net/mustwin/)


Write an application that takes in the number of pins knocked down on each roll, and output a scorecard as would be seen at a bowling alley. Don't forget about strikes, spares, and extra frames at the end.

  Note that this could be run when the bowler isn't done yet.
